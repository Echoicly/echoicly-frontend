  <h1>About Echoicly</h1>

  <h2>Why Echoicly?</h2>
  <p>Streaming changed music forever. But most artists earn too little â€“ and listeners have no idea where their money goes. Echoicly was created to change that.</p>

  <h2>What makes it different?</h2>
  <p>
    - 90% of your subscription fee goes directly to the artists you actually listen to.<br>
    - You can see exactly how much each artist receives.<br>
    - You can choose to give more to the artists you love.<br>
    - You can buy merch directly from them â€“ with no middleman.
  </p>

  <h2>How it works</h2>
  <p>Each month, your subscription is divided between the artists youâ€™ve played. You can view the breakdown, adjust the distribution, and even give tips or support by purchasing music and merchandise.</p>

  <h2>Who itâ€™s for</h2>
  <p>Echoicly is for music lovers who care about fairness, and for artists who want a deeper, more transparent connection with their audience.</p>

  <h2>Whatâ€™s next?</h2>
  <p>Weâ€™re currently building the full version. The current demo is AI-generated to showcase the concept. Soon, real development begins â€“ and you can be part of that journey.</p>
